If you have a very large configuration you may run out of stack-size. You can increase with such:
`node --max-old-space-size=8096 .\build_json.js`


## Support
Please note I cannot offer support. If you manage to get it to work for you, that is awesome; this was not designed with unofficials clusters in mind.

## Commandline arguments
- `nobuild` - Only process JSON and do not run servers. Useful for debugging.
- `debug` - Print more information
